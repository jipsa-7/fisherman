document.getElementsByTagName("li")[2].style.color="purple";----> getElements is plural so that means it is going to get back an array. document.getElementsByTagName("li") gives array of list elements and sets the list element at 2nd position as purple.

document.getElementsByClassName----->It allows you to select elements by their class name. getElements is plural so that means it is going to get back an array.so we must give square brackets and position to access a particular element. Even if there is only one element in that class we need to specify that.document.getElementsByClassName("btn")[0].style.color="red";

document.getElementById("title").innerHTML="Hello"; ---> get element by id is singular so we are going to get a single value. so need of square brackets and positions.

document.querySelector()--->It will only returns a single item. the string that we are writing inside the parantheses is a selector. selector is name of the element, id (#id), class (.classname)or combining them just like css selectors( element, id (#id), class (.classname)or combining them). document.querySelector("h1"),document.querySelector(".")
